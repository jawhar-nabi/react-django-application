#generic_views 


Django generic views are just view functions (regular old python functions) that do things that are very common in web applications.

Depending on the type of app you are building, they can save you from writing a lot of very simple views.



# Path && Url 
path() always matches the complete path, so path('account/login/') is equivalent to url('^account/login/$').


#####
In Python, r'^$'  is a regular expression that matches an empty line.
This looks like a regular expression (regex) commonly used in Django URL configurations.

The 'r' in front tells Python the expression is a raw string. In a raw string, escape sequences are not parsed. For example, '\n' is a single newline character. But, r'\n' would be two characters: a backslash and an 'n'.
